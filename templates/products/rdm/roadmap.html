      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          <strong>What does current, near-term and planned mean?</strong> <br />
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Current</strong> means that a development team is currently working on the
          feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Near-term</strong> means that a development team has planned to work on this
          feature as their next task.</li>
            <li><strong>Planned</strong> means that a development team has allocated time on their schedule to start work
          on the feature.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Will "current" features be released before
          "near-term" features?</strong> <br />
          No. It is not guaranteed that a feature currently under development will
          be released before a feature in the near-term column. Each feature may vary
          greatly in size and required effort, as can the team that implements the
          feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When will feature X be released?</strong> <br />
          New features are released as soon as they are ready in the next
          coming release. We on purpose do not communicate in which
          release a given feature will be shipped.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          <strong>Why do you not tie features to release dates?</strong> <br />
          We want to communicate clearly the inherent uncertainty in our planned
          schedule coming from developing a product as a large open source
          collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is the inherent uncertainties in your development schedule?</strong> <br />
          As a large open source collaboration, most our resources comes as opportunistic
          temporary resources. Partners may contribute developers on a short-term/long-term
          basis, full-time or part-time. This means the development teams are rarely stable
          for a longer period, and each team has different velocity and skillset. In addition,
          a large part of the developers participate in running services for their institution
          and services may from to time need immediate attention. We see all these challenges
          as strengths for the InvenioRDM community, that overall helps build a stronger
          and more resilient community, as well as building features that serve
          real needs for our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Can I use your roadmap to make commitments?</strong> <br />
          Any commitment you make is your own commitment and made at your own risk and
          you must evaluate the impact of not meeting your commitment. If you
          need a specific feature, the best you can do is to help accelerate the roadmap.
