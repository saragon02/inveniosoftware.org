# Inveniosoftware.org website

This is the official website for [InvenioSoftware.org](https://inveniosoftware.org) - the home of the Invenio digital library framework, InvenioRDM research data management platform and InvenioILS integrated library system.

## About

This website is built with [11ty (Eleventy)](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator that transforms templates into HTML. The site serves as the main hub for:

- **Invenio Framework**: A flexible digital library framework for building complex digital libraries and institutional repositories
- **InvenioRDM**: A turn-key research data management platform built on Invenio
- **InvenioILS**: An integrated library system for modern libraries
- **Community**: Resources, documentation, events, and support for the Invenio ecosystem

## Content Management

### Adding Blog Posts

1. Create a new markdown file in `src/blog-posts/`
2. Use the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`
3. Add:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
author: Author Name
date: YYYY-MM-DD
team: Invenio
permalink: "/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-post-title/"
---

Your blog content here...
```

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/blog-posts/image-filename.png)
```
